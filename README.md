# Show.me.home
The brief for this exercise reads, “A town is full with drunks”. As a town planning personnel, __create a model that simulates drunks’ likely routes home from a pub.__ This understanding should help the local planning authority put safeguards in place to protect its citizens.


__Software Design Process__


In approaching this work, I divided the problem into smaller chunks, beginning by answering three primary questions that I thought would help me develop my model.

__1.	Where is the pub?__

__2.	Where are the drunks’ homes?__ 

__3.	How can I identify patterns in paths taken home?__ 


To improve comprehension, I divided my code into three files. __The Environment.py__ file contains everything relevant to the environment. __The Framework.py__ file contains all attributional attributes, whereas the __Model.py file__ combines these two to create the animated model.
To improve reusability, code is commented. This program's architecture allows for future enhancements. Several tests are also run in the program to tell the developer of what is occurring at various levels of the written code.
