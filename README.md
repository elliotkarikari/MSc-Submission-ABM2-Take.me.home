# Show.me.home
The brief for this exercise reads, “A town is full with drunks”. As a town planning personnel, __create a model that simulates likely routes home after a night at the pub.__ This understanding should help the local planning authority put safeguards in place to protect its citizens.


__Software Design Process__


In approaching this work, I divided the problem into smaller chunks, beginning by answering three primary questions that I thought would help me develop my model.

__1.	Where is the pub?__

__2.	Where are the homes?__ 

__3.	How can I identify patterns in paths taken home?__ 


Data for the task is found in the __input file__


To improve comprehension, I divided my code into three files. __The Environment.py__ file contains everything relevant to the environment. __The Framework.py__ file contains all attributional attributes, whereas the __Model.py file__ combines these two to create the animated model. Once model is run, density(output) can be saved. Saved output is found as __environment_density.csv__
To improve reusability, code is commented. This program's architecture allows for future enhancements. Several tests are also run in the program to tell the developer of what is occurring at various levels of the written code.
